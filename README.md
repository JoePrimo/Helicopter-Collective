# Helicopter-Collective<br>
Helicopter Collective for DCS <br>
https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary

I made a collective for flying helicopters in DCS. This was a great project for learning about hall effect sensors and I also learned how to create a button matrix. <br>My goal with this project was to make it as low cost as possible so I built everything with scraps I had left around my workshop. <br>I even made my own hat switches.

<p> Here are a couple of videos showing my progress
